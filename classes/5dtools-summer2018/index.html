      <h2><span>11</span>Responsive Websites (Media Queries)<date>JUN 18</date></h2>
      <p>Reminder: You can view the requirements for your final <a href="#final">here</a>
      <p>In this day and age, all websites need to be as viewable on a desktop computer as on a phone. In web development, we use <strong>media queries</strong> to accomplish this. In this video I go through the following presentation, as well as the sample code to learn how.</p>

      <h3>Assignment</h3>
      <p>You've made the designs and you've gotten your sites online. If you haven't started working on your final yet, do that now. You can use and tweak snippets from work we've done throughout the semester, and reference all of our materials.</p>
      <p>When I get back we'll have a working class where I'll help you with your finals (or, I have a lesson on CSS Animation we can do if you'd all prefer that! Take <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdY1jnqTDkwLDVCADq5joD530Sh6U-W7Pw-clOvaFqVWXZH8w/viewform?usp=sf_link">this poll</a> to let me know which you'd prefer). Use today's lesson to meet the requirement for at least one implementation of a media query where something on your website changes upon resizing from large to small screen.</p>

      <p>Throughout the semester we will be working towards creating portfolio sites (or a different personal site).</p>
      <p>Create an HTML file from scratch called <code>index.html</code> (like we did in class), and add the following content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give your site a title and main heading telling me what type of site it will be. i.e. "Portfolio Site," "My Recipes," "Site About My Favorite Country."</li>
        <li>Write a short description about this website and why you want to make it. Is there anything special about it or things you're aiming to include?</li>
        <li>Your website will need to have at least 3 pages besides the home page. Make a list of what content will be on these three pages. i.e. "Page 1: Art project, Page 2: Game design project" ...etc. Make sure it's formatted correctly for HTML. If you don't know exactly what content will be there, that's okay, just get as specific as you can.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>What is GitHub and Why are We Using it?</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a version control system for code.</p>
        <p>Let’s say me and a friend are working on the same code on different computers. If we both change the same thing, we want to make sure that we pick the right version, and that when I make updates, the other person can get them without copying and pasting a bunch of things.</p>
        <p>When I’ve written some code that I want other people to get, I submit what’s called a Pull Request (PR). Before my code becomes part of the main system, someone checks it to make sure it’s written well and won’t screw anything up. This is the feature we’ll be using for checking homework because it allows me to comment on specific lines of code.</p>
        <p>You’ll submit PRs each week and I’ll comment on them until they’re good to go. Once it’s merged, you know it’s correct.</p>
