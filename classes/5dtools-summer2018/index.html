      <h2><span>10</span>Getting your site online<date>JUN 13</date></h2>
      <p>Let's get our websites to actually show up on the internet! You'll be able to create a domain (refer to our first vocab lesson on what "domain" means along with other terms), and access it on the ✨world wide web ✨ via a URL. </p>
      <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13DbODuS641rNPkjIwnHYv3u12cBgBREVwxG_tHIjxrw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Guide to Hosting a Static Website with Namecheap and AWS S3</a></p>
      <p>There's no video for this lesson, the guide should provide enough instruction for you to complete this. You can use any files we've created in class or anything you'd like to test with to see that your site is live. (A simple HTML page that says "Hello World!" is fine). As always, email me if you have questions, and feel free to work together on this!</p>
      <p>If you would prefer to use github pages or some other method of hosting your website, that's totally fine by me! I just don't have guides for those and you will have to figure them out on your own.</p>
      <h3>Assignment</h3>
      <p>Get your site online, and add the URL to a markdown <code>.md</code> file via Github (adding a markdown file per the instructions from the video in lesson 9) <em>15pts</em></p>

      <p>You'll be making websites for your final, and the code is important, but let's also make sure they look great. Today we're going over how to use <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> to design your websites.</p>

      <p>Create an HTML file from scratch called <code>index.html</code> (like we did in class), and add the following content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give your site a title and main heading telling me what type of site it will be. i.e. "Portfolio Site," "My Recipes," "Site About My Favorite Country."</li>
        <li>Write a short description about this website and why you want to make it. Is there anything special about it or things you're aiming to include?</li>
        <li>Your website will need to have at least 3 pages besides the home page. Make a list of what content will be on these three pages. i.e. "Page 1: Art project, Page 2: Game design project" ...etc. Make sure it's formatted correctly for HTML. If you don't know exactly what content will be there, that's okay, just get as specific as you can.</li>

        <h2>What is GitHub and Why are We Using it?</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a version control system for code.</p>
        <p>Let’s say me and a friend are working on the same code on different computers. If we both change the same thing, we want to make sure that we pick the right version, and that when I make updates, the other person can get them without copying and pasting a bunch of things.</p>
        <p>When I’ve written some code that I want other people to get, I submit what’s called a Pull Request (PR). Before my code becomes part of the main system, someone checks it to make sure it’s written well and won’t screw anything up. This is the feature we’ll be using for checking homework because it allows me to comment on specific lines of code.</p>
        <p>You’ll submit PRs each week and I’ll comment on them until they’re good to go. Once it’s merged, you know it’s correct.</p>
