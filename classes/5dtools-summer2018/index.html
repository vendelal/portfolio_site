      <h2><span>12</span>Working Class (Last Class!)<date>JUN 20</date></h2>
      <p>You can view the requirements for your final <a href="#final">here</a>
      <p><strong>Your final is due June 26th by 11:59pm EST</strong></p>
      <p>Use today to ask me questions and get some work done on your project.</p>

      <h2><span>11</span>Responsive Websites (Media Queries)<date>JUN 18</date></h2>
      <p>Reminder: You can view the requirements for your final <a href="#final">here</a>
      <p>In this day and age, all websites need to be as viewable on a desktop computer as on a phone. In web development, we use <strong>media queries</strong> to accomplish this. In this video I go through the following presentation, as well as the sample code to learn how.</p>

      <h3>Assignment</h3>
      <p>You've made the designs and you've gotten your sites online. If you haven't started working on your final yet, do that now. You can use and tweak snippets from work we've done throughout the semester, and reference all of our materials.</p>
      <p>When I get back we'll have a working class where I'll help you with your finals (or, I have a lesson on CSS Animation we can do if you'd all prefer that! Take <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdY1jnqTDkwLDVCADq5joD530Sh6U-W7Pw-clOvaFqVWXZH8w/viewform?usp=sf_link">this poll</a> to let me know which you'd prefer). Use today's lesson to meet the requirement for at least one implementation of a media query where something on your website changes upon resizing from large to small screen.</p>

      <h2><span>10</span>Getting your site online<date>JUN 13</date></h2>
      <p>Let's get our websites to actually show up on the internet! You'll be able to create a domain (refer to our first vocab lesson on what "domain" means along with other terms), and access it on the ✨world wide web ✨ via a URL. </p>
      <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13DbODuS641rNPkjIwnHYv3u12cBgBREVwxG_tHIjxrw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Guide to Hosting a Static Website with Namecheap and AWS S3</a></p>
      <p>There's no video for this lesson, the guide should provide enough instruction for you to complete this. You can use any files we've created in class or anything you'd like to test with to see that your site is live. (A simple HTML page that says "Hello World!" is fine). As always, email me if you have questions, and feel free to work together on this!</p>
      <p>If you would prefer to use github pages or some other method of hosting your website, that's totally fine by me! I just don't have guides for those and you will have to figure them out on your own.</p>
      <h3>Assignment</h3>
      <p>Get your site online, and add the URL to a markdown <code>.md</code> file via Github (adding a markdown file per the instructions from the video in lesson 9) <em>15pts</em></p>

      <p>Please create a markdown file using the instructions in the video to submit the link to your figma prototype.</p>
      <p>This and the rest of your the homeworks while I'm gone are not due until I get back, which gievs you plenty of time to complete these designs and the other assignments. <em>15pts</em></p>

      <p>Create an HTML file from scratch called <code>index.html</code> (like we did in class), and add the following content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give your site a title and main heading telling me what type of site it will be. i.e. "Portfolio Site," "My Recipes," "Site About My Favorite Country."</li>
        <li>Write a short description about this website and why you want to make it. Is there anything special about it or things you're aiming to include?</li>
        <li>Your website will need to have at least 3 pages besides the home page. Make a list of what content will be on these three pages. i.e. "Page 1: Art project, Page 2: Game design project" ...etc. Make sure it's formatted correctly for HTML. If you don't know exactly what content will be there, that's okay, just get as specific as you can.</li>

        <h2>What is GitHub and Why are We Using it?</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a version control system for code.</p>
        <p>Let’s say me and a friend are working on the same code on different computers. If we both change the same thing, we want to make sure that we pick the right version, and that when I make updates, the other person can get them without copying and pasting a bunch of things.</p>
        <p>When I’ve written some code that I want other people to get, I submit what’s called a Pull Request (PR). Before my code becomes part of the main system, someone checks it to make sure it’s written well and won’t screw anything up. This is the feature we’ll be using for checking homework because it allows me to comment on specific lines of code.</p>
        <p>You’ll submit PRs each week and I’ll comment on them until they’re good to go. Once it’s merged, you know it’s correct.</p>
