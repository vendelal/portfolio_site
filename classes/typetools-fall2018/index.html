        <h2><span>09</span>Composite Files and Typography for Mobile Design<date>NOV 6</date></h2>
        <p>I hope you voted today if you can! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</p>
        <p>Today we'll be covering how to create composite files in InDesign, and going over some questions people had after last week. I'll also be doing a quick demo of how to do some basic things in Figma in case you want to use it for your homework.</p>
        <p><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/6YkDCuyanozJ1QiQ2" target="_blank">Attendance for today</a> (Will get taken down after class)</p>

        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <p>Redesign a menu from your favorite restaurant to work for mobile <em>15pts</em></p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <img src="../img/IMG_7762.PNG" width="400px"/>
        <img src="../img/IMG_7763.PNG" width="400px"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Include at least 10 menu items</li>
            <li>Think about the type treatment for various types of information (title of the dish, ingredients, price, etc.)</li>
            <li>You can use any design program to create this. I would recommend using Figma since we just covered it, but if you'd rather practice more in InDesign and use paragraph styles, etc. feel free!</li>
            <li>Please make your document 375px wide (which is a typical size for phone screen designs)</li>
            <li>Export your design as a PDF and upload the <strong>one file</strong> to dropbox</li>
        </ul>
